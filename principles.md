# Principles

1. Time >> Money
2. Think in probabilities, nothing is absolute.
3. Avoid absolutism, most things are not binary, black or white, but have many shades of grey.
4. Trust, but Verify.
5. Use the Scientific Method
6. Be Data Driven, but understand it's bias and your own bias before analysis.
7. Follow the money (or incentives) to better appreciate someone's advice.
8. News is mostly noise, focus on the long term. Someone will tell you when something is important.
