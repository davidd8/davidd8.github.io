# Company Principles
... or an ideal company set up.

Top Line
* Mission-driven. A strong purpose creates more value.
* Impact Focus. Ensure your work matters. The key dimension across any activity.
* Build something people want and are excited about.

Work Practices
* Iteration Over Perfection. Speed matters.
* High Output Metrics. Measure the important stuff, ignore the rest. No vanity metrics.
* Learning Loops. Build in feedback loops to make a better company, product, process.
* Have User Empathy.
* Results oriented.

People
* Trust People First.
* Treat professionally and fairly.
* Invest in people's potential, foster growth.
* Meaningful Ownership. Empower people to solve problems, and reward proportionally.
* Recognize work is a long game, people come in and out, support for the long run.

Communication
* Clear expectations.
* Transparency in communication and strategy. Upfront and honest.
* One place to post updates. One place to read updates. No multi-channel combinatorial duplication of slack messages.
* Async-first. People need time to digest information to have thoughtful discussions. Choose email.

Operations
* Equal pay per role and level.
* Performance reviews after profitability. And even then, spend as little time as possible on it.
* Spend wisely, on things that compound to improve workplace productivity and satisfaction. Perks matter.
* Hire/Promote from within. Prioritize from within, then 1st degree referrals, and so on.
* Interview Efficiently. Time is a crucial advantage. Don't keep the candidate waiting, don't waste employees' time.
* Remove friction. Add process slowly, review regularly, and cut liberally.
  
Work Life
* Collaborative process with single-threaded decision making.
* Remote-friendly. It doesn't have to be fully-remote, but being remote should not put an employee at a disadvantage.
* Minimize meetings. Avoid the back-to-back meetings everyday. Even executives should have a couple hours of focus time everyday.
* Encourage creativity. Promote office chatter and camraderie, i.e. water cooler talk.
* Flexible work environment and schedule, as long as the work gets done.
* Allow people to make space for life's important moments (outside of work).

Bottom Line
* It should be a fun environment, where you enjoy the craft and the people around you. 
* A place you would highly recommend your friends and family to work at.
