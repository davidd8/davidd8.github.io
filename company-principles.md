# Company Principles
... or an ideal company set up.

* Mission-driven. A company with a strong purpose creates a lot more value.
* Remote-friendly. It doesn't have to be fully-remote, but being remote should not put an employee at a disadvantage.
* Async-first. People need time to digest information to have thoughtful discussions.
* Minimize meetings. Avoid the back-to-back meetings everyday. Even executives should have a couple hours of focus time everyday.
* High Output Metrics. Measure the important stuff, ignore the rest. No vanity metrics.
* Iteration Over Perfection. Speed matters.
* Learning Loops. Built-in learning to make a better company, product, process. Leverage the user.
* Treat everyone as a professional. Don't assume people can't handle the truth.
* Transparency in communication and strategy. Upfront and honest, no fakeness or making it seem better than it is; it is what it is.
* One place to post updates. One place to read updates. No multi-channel combinatorial duplication of slack messages. Choose email.
* Meaningful Ownership. Everyone should be empowered to solve problems, and be rewarded proportionally.
* Invest in People's Potential. Belief that anyone can do anything they put their mind to. Give people the opportunity.
* Hire/promote from within first.
* Spend wisely. Spend time on things that matter. Spend money on employees and perks and benefits to make them happy and productive.
* People first. Look out for what the individual wants. The company may not be the right fit for them, and that's ok. People and companies change over time.
* Equal pay per role and level.
* Performance Reviews only after profitability. And even then, spend as little time as possible on it.
* Collaborative process with single-threaded decision making.
* Build something people want and are excited about. 
* It should be a fun environment, where you enjoy the people around you and your craft. 
* A place you would highly recommend your friends and family to work at.
